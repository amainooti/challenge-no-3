# Weather App - Backend Challenge

This is a weather application built as part of the **20 Backend Challenge**. The app provides real-time weather data for various cities using a third-party weather API. The app implements caching using **Redis** to minimize external API requests and improve response times for frequently queried cities. The backend is developed using **NestJS**, with caching and HTTP request functionalities integrated.

## Features

- Fetches current weather data for any city.
- Caches weather data using **Redis** to avoid redundant API calls and improve performance.
- Handles common HTTP errors gracefully.
- Custom timeout for API requests to handle latency issues.
- Organized and scalable **NestJS** structure for easy maintainability.
- Fully Dockerized environment for Redis and the NestJS app.

---

## Technologies Used

- **NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, scalable server-side applications.
- **Redis**: An in-memory key-value store used for caching.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the weather API.
- **RxJS**: Used for handling observables from HTTP requests.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application and Redis.
- **RedisInsight/Redis Commander**: For visualizing Redis cache (optional).

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for running Redis)
- [RedisInsight](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise/redis-insight/) (optional, for visualizing Redis data)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app.git
   cd weather-app
   \`\`\`

2. Install dependencies:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

3. Start Redis using Docker:
   \`\`\`bash
   docker run --name redis-weather-app -p 6379:6379 -d redis
   \`\`\`

4. Set up environment variables (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)).

5. Run the development server:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm run start:dev
   \`\`\`

---

## Environment Variables

You need to set the following environment variables in a \`.env\` file:

\`\`\`bash
API_KEY=your_weather_api_key # Your API key for the weather service
BASE_URL=https://weather.visualcrossing.com # The base URL for the weather API
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
CACHE_TTL=300 # Time to live for cache in seconds (default is 5 minutes)
\`\`\`

---

## Usage

Once the app is up and running, you can fetch the weather for any city by hitting the \`/weather\` endpoint:

Example:

\`\`\`bash
curl http://localhost:3000/weather?city=London
\`\`\`

The response will either return cached data (if available) or fetch fresh data from the weather API and cache it.

---

## API Endpoints

### 1. Get Weather Data

- **Endpoint**: \`/weather?city=<city_name>\`
- **Method**: \`GET\`
- **Description**: Fetches the weather data for a specified city.
- **Response**:
  \`\`\`json
  {
  "temperature": 20,
  "humidity": 78,
  "condition": "Cloudy",
  "city": "London"
  }
  \`\`\`

- **Query Parameters**:
  - \`city\` (required): The name of the city you want to get weather data for.

---

## Caching Mechanism

- **Redis** is used to cache the weather data for a specified TTL (default: 300 seconds or 5 minutes).
- When a city is requested, the app first checks the Redis cache for existing data. If found, it serves the cached data. If not, it fetches the data from the weather API and stores it in Redis.
- Cache key format: \`city-data:<city_name>\`

---

## Error Handling

- **404 Not Found**: Returned when the city cannot be found in the external weather API.
- **400 Bad Request**: Returned for invalid API requests (e.g., missing city parameter).
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Returned for unexpected errors or issues with the external API.
- **408 Request Timeout**: Returned if the external API takes too long to respond.

---

## Docker Setup

You can also run the Redis server using Docker Compose for easier setup. Create a \`docker-compose.yml\` file like this:

\`\`\`yml
version: '3'
services:
redis:
image: redis:latest
container_name: redis-weather-app
ports: - '6379:6379'
\`\`\`

To spin up Redis using Docker Compose:
\`\`\`bash
docker-compose up -d
\`\`\`
